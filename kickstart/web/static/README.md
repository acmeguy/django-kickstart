Bootstrap
=========

I use bootstrap in my demo html templates and user the smartbiz bootstrap wrapper (http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB006P073)
but it should looks ok'ish using normal bootstrap.

By default the skin in the "/kicktheme" static directory are used so you need to rename the skin directory if you use
that or change the settings.SKIN variable to point to the proper directory. you may need to change import links
in the files in /web/templates/snippets/* as well.
