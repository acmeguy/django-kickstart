django-kickstart
================

An attempt to create a private django kickstart, please view this as "learn by doing" exceercise rather than a viable option for anyone other than me.

I like to use postgresql for development

Install at lease 9.2 (has some functionality I would like to explore)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pitti/postgresql
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.2
